This is a simple gem that implements the basic operations of a financial calculator including:

- Perpetuities.
- Annuities.
- Net present value of a cashflow

Just install de gem, create an instance of the class FinCalc and use the proper method.  You can see the tests to get and idea of the usage of the gem.

Be free to fork, and contribute.  I did this gem to help myself with my MBA finance classes (initially on php and now I ported to ruby), and I hope this small contribution can help.
